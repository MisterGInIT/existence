This Jekyll theme was created to replace a theme I had previously created for Wordpress. Using the Bootstrap 4 framework, it is responsive and ready for mobile devices. It will work flawlessly on Google Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari, and Internet Explorer 11 (if you have to use that).

One of the goals I had in mind for this theme was to emulate a Wordpress blog. Using the Jekyll Paginate plugin, you can choose how many blog posts to display on each page, with a simple next / previous button. Each blog excerpt will display a Read More button, and each post will contain the date, blog author, title, and tags. Both tags and categories can be used.

One of the challenges with a statically hosted website is the lack of dynamic content, such as a comments form. While there are third-party commenting systems and add-ons available, many of them do not respect the privacy of website visitors as they gather, track, and profile identities. One alternative is to use a serverless / functions service, however this would require additional setup and is not simple to implement. The solution this theme uses is the ability to embed a Twitter tweet. Simply add the Tweet ID, which is part of the Twitter URL for a tweet, and it will display at the bottom of the blog post with a Reply on Twitter button. If not Tweet ID is added to a blog post, it simply states that comments are disabled.

The Existence theme also adopts an easily customizable navigation menu at the top of the page, with options for a dropdown menu. Social media icons can be added easily, for all popular social media platforms, displaying the icons in the sidebar.

There is also an RSS feed, another important feature for any blogger.

I hope you enjoy the Existence theme. It has been the result of many late nights and drinking way too much coffee.
